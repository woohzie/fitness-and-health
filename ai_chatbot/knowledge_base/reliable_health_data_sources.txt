## Data Integration Considerations for RAG System

When integrating these sources into your RAG system:

1. **Prioritize authoritative sources**: Government health organizations and major medical institutions should be given higher priority in your knowledge base.

2. **Check for currency**: Health recommendations can change; ensure you're using the most recent guidelines (typically within the last 5 years).

3. **Cross-reference information**: When information appears contradictory, cross-reference multiple sources and prioritize consensus views.

4. **Consider audience appropriateness**: Ensure content is accessible to general users while maintaining accuracy.

5. **Maintain source attribution**: When adding content to your knowledge base, maintain clear records of the source to ensure proper attribution and allow for updates when source material changes.

6. **Segment by topic**: Organize your knowledge base into clear categories (nutrition, exercise, medical, etc.) to improve retrieval relevance.

7. **Include BMI-specific content**: Ensure you have adequate information for each BMI category to provide tailored responses.
