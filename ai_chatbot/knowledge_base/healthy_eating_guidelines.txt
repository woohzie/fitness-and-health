## The Healthy Eating Plate

The Healthy Eating Plate, created by nutrition experts at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, provides detailed guidance for creating balanced, healthy meals.

### 1. Vegetables and Fruits (½ of your plate)

- Aim for color and variety
- The more vegetables — and the greater the variety — the better
- Potatoes and french fries don't count as vegetables because of their negative impact on blood sugar
- Eat plenty of fruits of all colors
- Choose whole fruits over juices for the full nutritional benefits

### 2. Whole Grains (¼ of your plate)

- Choose whole and intact grains—whole wheat, barley, wheat berries, quinoa, oats, brown rice
- Limit refined grains (white rice, white bread)
- Whole grains contain the bran and germ, which provide fiber, B vitamins, and minerals

### 3. Protein (¼ of your plate)

- Choose fish, poultry, beans, nuts, and other plant sources of protein
- Limit red meat and avoid processed meats like bacon and sausage
- Nuts and beans are excellent plant sources of protein and fiber
- Fish provides heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids

### 4. Healthy Oils (in moderation)

- Use olive, canola, and other plant oils in cooking, on salads, and at the table
- Limit butter and avoid trans fat
- Healthy oils reduce harmful cholesterol and are good for the heart

### 5. Water

- Drink water, tea, or coffee (with little or no sugar)
- Limit milk/dairy to 1-2 servings per day
- Limit juice to a small glass per day
- Avoid sugary drinks

### 6. Stay Active

- The red figure running across the Healthy Eating Plate's placemat is a reminder that staying active is important in weight control

## Special Dietary Considerations

### Age-Related Nutrition Needs

1. **Young adults (18-30):**
   - Higher calorie needs, especially if active
   - Bone-building nutrients (calcium, vitamin D)
   - Iron (especially for menstruating women)

2. **Middle-aged adults (31-50):**
   - Gradually decreasing calorie needs
   - Continued focus on nutrient density
   - Increased attention to heart health

3. **Older adults (51+):**
   - Lower calorie needs but higher protein requirements
   - Increased need for certain vitamins (B12, D)
   - Calcium for bone health
   - Fiber for digestive health

### Gender-Specific Considerations

1. **Women:**
   - Higher iron needs during menstruating years
   - Folate needs (especially during reproductive years)

### Medical Conditions

Always consult healthcare providers for personalized nutrition advice related to medical conditions such as:

- Food allergies or intolerances

## Hydration Guidelines

### Daily Fluid Needs

1. **General recommendations:**
   - Women: About 11.5 cups (2.7 liters) of fluids daily
